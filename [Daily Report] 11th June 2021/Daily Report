Here is the daily status report on learned and working with the Ruby on Rails Application.

1. Learned about Webpack watch and learned the differences between "--watch" and "--hot".
2. Displaying the cart items on the products page using stimulus.
3. Working on Add to cart functionality to make it looks like a Single Page Application.

The task that should be completed by tomorrow is:

1. On the products page a button named (Add to Cart) should be there, by clicking it the product should be added to the backend.  
2. In the front-end the count should be displayed.
3. On Adding the product, if the process is successful It should throw a confirmation message.
if any validation is not correct throw an error message that " The product is not added to cart".
4. This whole process should be done by using Stimulus js.
5. There should be no static code in the front end.
