Here is the daily status report on learned and working with the Ruby on Rails Application.

1. Learned about the flow of Check-Out functionality.
2. Using stimulus added a quantity field in my stimulus controller, which adds the quantity of the products in the cart.
3. Studied the check-out process and the approach to doing it.
Need to do some changes in the code and will push the code as early as possible. 
Here's the link to my Github repository of my "Depot-App".

Tasks that are to be completed by tomorrow are:

1. Structure the Check-out functionality using a flow diagram.
2. Get a complete flow of understanding in an MVC Architecture view.
3. Try to implement the structure using flowcharts for better understanding.
