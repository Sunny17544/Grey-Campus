Here is the daily status report on learned and working with the Ruby on Rails Application.

1. Learned about Fetch call for making Post request to the cart
2.Added a button to the line_items page which adds the product using fetch call and renders the changes within the page.
3. learned about data attributes.
Changes have been saved in my Github Repository on Depot-App, Here's my GitHub link to my Depot App:

Tasks that are to be completed by this weekend are:

1. Complete the add to cart functionality using stimulus.
2. Display the cart_items in the product that shows the usage without rendering the pages like a single page application.
3. Try to implement using the (data-url) attribute without using a static URL in the controller.
