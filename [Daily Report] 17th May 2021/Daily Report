1. Learnt Ruby Basic concepts under Ruby Primer (Ascent) " rubymonk.com ".
    The concepts are:- 
            1. More Classes ( Completed the modules from 00 to 03) and "module 04" is on  pending because the coding part in this section is quite harder and I am still working on it.
            2. Advanced Arrays ( Completed the modules from 00 to 02) and "module 03" is pending due to the complexity of the module. I am working on it.
            3. Advanced Modules ( Completed all modules from 00 to 02)            4. Exceptions (Currently working on this section).
2. Practised some programs for better understanding of syntax are in "rubymonk.com". The concepts that I worked on are :-
        1. attr_reader and attr_writer.
        2. Block conversion.
        3. Class instance variables.        4. Class variables.        5. Equality Operator.        6. (Implicit to Explicit) and (Explicit to Implicit).        7. Overriding.        8. Super-Powered.
3. Configured my Git-Hub and added my daily report and the programs to my "Grey Campus " repository. Here's the link to the Github repo.
