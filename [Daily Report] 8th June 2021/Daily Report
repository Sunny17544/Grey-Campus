Dear Team,

Here is the daily status report on learned and working with the Ruby on Rails Application.

1. Learned about lifecycles in the stimulus.
2. Studied Data Attributes in the stimulus.
3. Tried to implement the add to cart functionality on the server-side but need to work on it more.
4. Added a text field in ine-items that displays a number of items in the cart.
