Here is my daily report status on Working with the Ruby on Rails Application.

1. Created "Add to Card" Functionalities App separately but will integrate these functionalities in my "Depot App".
2. Tried to implement Mathematical Operations in Card App for calculations of the Amount in it. 
3. Learned about Helpers, Associations, and using the console for the interaction with databases.
4. Done Unit testing and written some test cases with success and failures.

The Tasks that are to be completed by Tomorrow are:

1. Make the Card functionalities work properly in the "Depot App".
2. Create related (Line items and Products) models and controllers for "Card" to interlink with the Card Functionalities.
3. Should learn about Functional testing of Controllers.
4.  Study about Caching of partial results.
