Dear Team,

Here is my daily report status on learning and creating a Ruby on Rails application. I am sharing the following information.

1. Created a simple CRUD Application with Ruby on Rails. 
2. Learnt MVC Architecture Functioning and Procedure and working on it in Application View.
3. Studied some topics related to Ruby on Rails in "guides.rubyonrails.org" (Getting started with Rails).
4. Still need to work and learn more on "Ruby on Rails" in application view.
